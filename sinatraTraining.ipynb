    "As you can see, the program complains a lot. Ignore it. We'll have time to fix that in a near future. The output of the program is a tsv table (tab separated values). Since weka and python ML-methods recognise classes in a different way (for ewka, they must be nominal and for python, they must be numbers), the classes are give back as numbers. Weka does need letters or something nominal (it's kinda stupid, but this is how it works). So we need to substitute the last term of the columns by a specific letter. If you are doing right and you are using linux, this is trivial. Supossing that your file name is \"data11.txt\". Just type then:\n",

Just change type to \"all the files\", and you'll see. The program might complain, but just ignore it. Then, go to classify, and play. My favourite method is logistic regression (within the functions), but is true that it isnt really good when facing non linear problems. Neural Networks are cool but they take much time and resources. Bayessian methods are usually poor, but they are cheap. You can also use SMO, some metaclassifier, and all that.\n",
